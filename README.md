# All Hands On Deck - FRONTEND README

## Project Overview

All Hands on Deck is a card app with a Rails API backend and a React frontend. Players can create a new deck with the standard 52-cards, and then draw five cards from that deck in perpetuum until they're out of cards. At which point, they can (and will be prompted to!) simply create a new deck. 🃏👌🏼

## GettingStarted

### Installing

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Clone down the repo and with the Rails backend server running, in the root of the project directory run:

`npm install`

then:

`npm start`

The first option is to create a "New Deck" of cards, after which the next option to "Draw Five" and from there on, happy card playing! 🤙🏼
